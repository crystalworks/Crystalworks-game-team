## Setup

Navigate to the `game` directory.

Install all dependencies with:

    $ npm install

## How to use

### Run the development server:

    $ npm run dev

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter `localhost:3000` into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser.

### Build for deployment:

    $ npm run deploy

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
