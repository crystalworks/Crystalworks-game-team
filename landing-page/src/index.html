      The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. 
      Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced 
      in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

        <p class="content__text">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and 
          typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
          when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

        <h4 class="content__title">Why do we use it?</h4>
        <p class="content__text">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted 
          by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that 
          it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
          making it look like readable English.
